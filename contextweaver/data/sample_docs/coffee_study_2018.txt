Title: Coffee and Cardiovascular Risk Study (2018)

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between coffee consumption
and cardiovascular disease risk. We analyzed data from 10,000 participants
over a 5-year period.

Results: Our findings indicate that high coffee consumption (>5 cups/day)
is associated with a 23% increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Limitations: This study did not control for confounding variables such as
smoking, sugar intake, or exercise habits.

Conclusion: High coffee consumption may increase cardiovascular risk.
