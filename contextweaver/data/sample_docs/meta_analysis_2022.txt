Title: Meta-Analysis of Coffee and Heart Health Studies (2022)

Abstract: This meta-analysis reviews 50 studies published between 2010-2022
examining coffee's effects on cardiovascular health.

Key Findings:
- Early studies (2010-2019) showed mixed results
- Studies failing to control for confounders showed negative effects
- Recent studies with better controls show neutral or positive effects
- The apparent contradiction stems from methodological differences

Explanation: Previous negative findings were likely due to confounding
variables. Coffee itself does not increase cardiovascular risk when
consumed moderately.

Recommendation: Current evidence supports moderate coffee consumption
as safe or potentially beneficial for heart health.
