Title: Protective Effects of Moderate Coffee Intake (2023)

Abstract: Recent research suggests that moderate coffee consumption may
have protective cardiovascular effects. This study examines 15,000 participants
with rigorous controls for lifestyle factors.

Methodology: Unlike previous studies, we controlled for smoking, diet,
exercise, and sugar intake to isolate coffee's effects.

Results: Moderate coffee consumption (2-3 cups/day) shows a 15% reduction
in cardiovascular disease risk. Heavy consumption (>5 cups) shows neutral effects.

Conclusion: When confounding factors are controlled, moderate coffee intake
appears beneficial for heart health.
